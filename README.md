## Quickstart

Download latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/SvenTo/steampipe-plugin-cf/releases/).

Unzip and install the plugin:

```shell
gzip -d steampipe-plugin-cf_*.gz
chmod +x steampipe-plugin-cf_*
mkdir -p ~/.steampipe/plugins/hub.steampipe.io/plugins/svento/cf@latest/
mv steampipe-plugin-cf_* ~/.steampipe/plugins/hub.steampipe.io/plugins/svento/cf@latest/steampipe-plugin-cf.plugin
# download default config:
wget -O ~/.steampipe/config/cf.spc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SvenTo/steampipe-plugin-cf/main/config/cf.spc
```

```

Try it!

```
steampipe query
> .inspect cf
```

Run a query:

```sql
select
  a.name,
  a.state,
  s.name as space_name,
  o.name as org_name
from
  cf_app as a,
  cf_space as s,
  cf_org as o
where
  s.org_guid = o.guid and 
  a.space_guid = s.guid;
```
